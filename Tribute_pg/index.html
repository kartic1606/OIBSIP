            <h3>Brief About Ramanujan</h3>
            <p>
                A self trained prodigy,Who dedicated his whole life to mathematics.he made significant contributions to the field of infinite series, number theories, analysis and fractions.  He even provided solutions to mathematical problems that were deemed to be unsolvable by other geniuses. He faced failure in his early years and also suffered financially, but managed to attend the ‘University of Cambridge’ with the help of G.H Hardy, who was quite impressed with his work. In his short life, Ramanujam made ground-breaking contribution in the field of mathematics. A peer-reviewed scientific journal ‘The Ramanujan Journal’ was established to publish all mathematical work. He died at 32.

                <h4>Infinite Series</h4>

                <p>
                In England, Srinivasa made great progress working with Hardy and Littlewood. He was exceptionally good at infinite series. Before him, there was an infinite series for pi(3.14159263589..). However, the problem was that it was prolonged. For example, it took about 600 terms to come to a value of 3.14. On the other hand, Ramanujan developed a series that would converge to 3.141592 just after one term.

                <h4>Ramanujan Summation</h4>

                <p>
                Srinivasa Ramanujan did interesting mathematics in the field of infinite summation. He invented a summation, which is a technique for assigning a value to divergent infinite series. It is essentially a property of the partial sums rather than a property of the entire sum. For example, this method for summation of numbers points to the fact that ‘S’= -1/12, where S = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+……..Though this result is shocking, string theory, quantum field theory, and some complex analytics extensively use this to derive equations.

            <div id="Highly composite numbers">
                <h4>Highly composite numbers</h4>
                <img src="http://www.javascripter.net/math/calculators/ramanujanhighlycompositenumberslist.jpg" alt="highly composite numbers">
                <p>
                Ramanujan worked intensively on highly composite numbers. A highly composite number is basically a positive integer that has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. He coined this term in 1915. There is an infinite number of highly composite numbers, the first few being 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60…and so on. The corresponding numbers of divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12… and so on. In 1915, he listed 102 highly composite numbers up to 6746328388800. Later in 1983 and 1988, Robin & Nicholas modified this list.

                <p>
                Another famous incident that shows Ramanujan’s love for numbers was when Hardy once met him in the hospital. When Hardy got there, he told Ramanujan that his cab’s number, 1729, was “rather a dull number” and hoped it didn’t turn out to be an unfavorable omen. To this, Ramanujan said, “No, it is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as a sum of two cubes in two different ways.” 13 + 123 and 93 + 103. This number is now known as the Hardy-Ramanujan number.

            <p>
                The influence of Ramanujan on number theory is without parallel in mathematics. His papers, problems and letters have spawned a remarkable number of later results by many different mathematicians. His 37 published papers, most of his first two and last letters to Hardy, the famous 58 problems submitted to the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society, and the commentary of the original editors (Hardy, Seshu Aiyar and Wilson) are reprinted again, after having been unavailable for some time. In this, the third printing of Ramanujan's collected papers, Bruce Berndt provides an annotated guide to Ramanujan's work and to the mathematics it inspired over the last three-quarters of a century. The historical development of ideas is traced in the commentary and by citations to the copious references.

            <h3>Ramanujan: Letters and Commentary</h3>

            <p>
                The letters that Ramanujan wrote to G. H. Hardy on January 16 and February 27, 1913, are two of the most famous letters in the history of mathematics. This book brings together many letters to, from, and about Ramanujan. The letters came from the National Archives in Delhi, the Archives in the State of Tamil Nadu, and a variety of other sources. Helping to orient the reader is the extensive commentary, both mathematical and cultural, by Berndt and Rankin; in particular, they discuss in detail the history, up to the present day, of each mathematical result in the letters. Containing many letters that have never been published before, this book will appeal to those interested in Ramanujan's mathematics as well as those wanting to learn more about the personal side of his life.

                <p>
                    The Lost Notebook of S.R. Ramanujan was brought to light in 1976 as part of the Watson bequest, by G.E. Andrews with whose introduction this collection of unpublished manuscripts opens. A major portion of the Lost Notebook - really just 90 unpaginated sheets of work on q -series and other topics - is reproduced here in facsimile. Letters from Ramanujan to Hardy as well as various other sheets of seemingly related notes are then included, on topics including coefficients in the 1/q3 and 1/q2 problems and the mock theta functions. The next 180 pages consist of unpublished manuscripts of Ramanujan, including 28 pages from the 'Loose Papers' held in the Trinity College Library. Finally a number of interesting letters that were exchanged between Ramanujan, Littlewood, Hardy and Watson, with a bearing on Ramanujan's work are collected together here with other extracts and fragments.
